# Survival Analysis with Kaplan-Meier Curves, Log-Rank Test, and Weibull Model Fitting

## Overview

This repository provides an analysis of survival data using various survival analysis techniques in R. The analysis involves comparing survival times across two groups using **Kaplan-Meier survival curves**, performing the **log-rank test** for statistical comparison, and fitting **Weibull models** to the survival data.

## Requirements

Before using the code in this repository, ensure that you have the following R packages installed:

- **survival**: For performing survival analysis and fitting survival models.
- **survminer**: For visualizing survival curves and other survival analysis results.

To install the necessary packages, you can run the following commands in R:

```R
install.packages("survival")
install.packages("survminer")
